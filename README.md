# Introduction:
Every 6 minutes, someone in the United States is diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease, with an anticipated 1.2 million cases by 2030 (Parkinson’s Foundation). To address the lack of early intervention, my project utilizes data from 50,000 participants to develop models predicting disease risk and progression.

# Data Collection:
Leveraging Michael J. Fox Foundation data, detailed demographic information and clinical characteristics were examined. Despite incomplete observations, this rich dataset enabled a comprehensive exploration of risk factors and early indicators.

# Model Development:
Utilizing a Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis, a risk assessment model was created. Common risk factors, including caffeine and smoking, were used in Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) models predicting age at diagnosis. A Logistic Regression model was developed to predict disease progression, achieving a robust 73.85% accuracy.

# Synthesis:
These models offer transformative potential by improving patient outcomes, reducing intensive treatments, and cutting healthcare costs. They also set the stage for future investigations, providing insights into complex interactions among genetic, environmental, and demographic factors. Ultimately, this project aims to contribute to bridging the diagnostic gap and alleviating the socioeconomic burden associated with Parkinson’s disease.

Note: Due to the substantial size of the dataset, providing it as a single Excel sheet is currently unfeasible. Splitting the data into separate Excel sheets would require significant code modifications. If you have specific data requests or if there's a preferred format for data distribution, please let me know, and I'll do my best to accommodate your needs. Thank you for your understanding.
